    <div class="privacy-body">
        <p>BYF Crochet Company. (“Company,” “we”, or “us”) respects the privacy rights of its website users. The following “Privacy Policy,” is meant to be read and understood in conjunction with our online terms and conditions, http://www.byfcrochet.com/terms-of-use, (“Terms”) and any capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined will have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms. This Privacy Policy describes our information collection and use practices in connection with our Site and the Services, as well as any circumstances under which we may disclose information collected from you.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><span>I. GENERAL TERMS AND HOW YOU ACCEPT THIS POLICY</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>When you visit the Site or submit Personal Information (as defined below) through the Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Site may contain links to third party websites or services (“Third Party Services”). Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Third Party Services. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every website or service they visit, including any Third Party Services. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site or Services.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><span>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>“Personal Information” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, payment information, as well as any other information about you that is associated or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Non-Personal Information” means data that is anonymous and cannot be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity. Non-Personal Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, as described below. We collect Personal Information as required to offer Services, as listed in the Terms, as voluntarily provided by you in the course of correspondence or registration, and as otherwise identified below, such as information you voluntarily provide to us. When you visit the Site, we may collect Non-Personal Information such as device related information, like your IP Address, or server log information, including the date and time you visit. This information may be used to diagnose problems with our server, or to gain an understanding about who is using the Site.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When registering for the Services, each Registered User will be asked to provide a username, email address and to create a unique password that, along with a provided email address, enables access to certain parts of the Service, such as payment and our learning programme. We may track the use of those email addresses and passwords in order to collect and maintain records of individual transactions conducted through the Service by Registered Users, and those records may be associated with each Registered User's individual Account profile within our system. Email addresses may also be used to provide Optional Communications (as defined below).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Personal Information necessary to complete a payment may include first and last name, email address, physical address (shipping and billing if different), phone number and credit or debit card information or other information required to complete your purchase. When you place an order through the Site you are required to submit such payment information either to us or a third-party e-commerce platform engaged by us. We may provide your Personal Information to those third parties in order to facilitate your transaction and customer service, and they may provide certain information to us all for the purpose of completing the transaction that you requested us to perform.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><span>III. USE AND DISCLOSURE</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>We may use information collected from the Site and the Services in several ways, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use Personal Information as needed to provide the Site and the Services to you, to create an Account for you, and to communicate with you regarding your use of the Services. We may also use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when evaluating ways to improve the Site and the Service. As further described below, in limited circumstances we may disclose collected information, including Personal Information, to certain third parties in connection as necessary to provide Services or as required by law.
        <br>
        Payment information is collected directly by a third-party payment provider engaged by us in order to complete an order, and such information may be stored in such third-party’s secured database. This third party will use that Personal Information only to process and confirm your transaction, provide customer service, and fulfill your order and deliver items to you, and maintain order history. If you are a Registered User, your Personal Information may also be stored for the purpose of processing any future payments that you make for additional goods and services. However, if you complete your transactions as a “guest” ("Not a registered User"), your credit card or payment data will not be stored and you will need to re-supply such card card/payment details to make any future purchases. We will share your Personal Information with our third payment provider only to the extent necessary for the purposes of fulfilling and servicing your requested transaction.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you communicate with us through the “Contact Us,” or similar sections, links, email addresses, or features on the Site, we will use the Personal Information that you submit to us, including your Account information if applicable, in order to communicate with you about your questions and comments. We encourage community participation through the submission of stories, projects, reviews and other contributed content. You must be a Registered User in order to submit a review or such other content. We typically display the first name from the Registered User's Account, but we do not reveal other Personal Information associated with your Account except with your pre-approval.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information about you collected through the Site or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements. We may also disclose Personal Information to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Services and/or to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms. </p>
        <br>
        <h3><span>IV. USE OF COOKIES</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>The Site may use, and by using the Site you hereby accept the use of, “cookies”, which are small files placed on your computer's hard drive, if your web browser’s security settings so allow, which allow us to recognize you as a user when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser. A cookie will not collect Personal Information from you. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but most browsers also allow the user to modify settings to decline cookies. Please consult the supporting documentation for your web browser for more specific information on declining cookies. If you decline cookies you may still access the Site, although some functionality may be limited.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We use cookies, beacons or other means to identify when different accounts are linked to the same user, using the same payment information, same IP address, same email address, etc. We may use cookies to identify which pages within the Site are being used by whom. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our Site in order to tailor it to user needs.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><span>V. ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION/OPT-OUT/DELETION</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed in order to perform the purposes for which such information was collected. You may request at any time to access or update your Personal Information, or that we delete any of your Personal Information stored by us, by contacting us at support@lionbrand.com. However, we may not be able to delete all information accessed or provided through us if we do not control such information, such as information originating through a social media network or other third party service providers. Following any such request, we will take reasonable steps to provide, modify or delete your Personal Information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
